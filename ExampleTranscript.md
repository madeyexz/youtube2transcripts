**Interviewer:** So first of all, I I just want to thank Elon for coming. Uh hungry. You didn't even have dinner and we didn't even feed you properly.

**Elon Musk:** Absolutely. No, no, sorry to be a bit late. Um, it's came from the Tesla factory in in Fremont.

**Interviewer:** Oh no. Yes. Is it Was something wrong with Did you

**Elon Musk:** There's always something wrong. You have to like That's a given point. There's always something wrong.

**Interviewer:** Yes.

**Elon Musk:** Um, cuz there's just too many things going on. Yeah. So, um I mean one of the trickiest things about a car is that there's there's there's thousands of of individual components. There's thousands of unique components. And even if one of those things is missing, you can't make cars. Yes. So, I mean today's uh fiasco was um I kid you not, um we were missing a $3 USB cable.

**Interviewer:** Okay. So we cannot complete cars because

**Elon Musk:** The whole line was stopped.

**Interviewer:** Yeah. So essentially because

**Elon Musk:** It's part of the wiring harness. So you can't put the interior in um without this this cable. Um, and so we could either make a whole bunch of cars minus an interior, which means that you got to stack them up in the yard. No, no. The resale value would be no good. Well, it it can be done but but it's it's then things go out of sequence. Oh, right, right, right. Um, and and uh it's way more um it's it's way more inef- it's what you can't you don't have a music moving production line. Then you have to send people out to hundreds of of cars that are sort of sitting in the storage yard. And um so we we we uh And this happens to be a particularly pernicious cable that's kind of like routed under the carpet and and a difficult place. Um, and it's literally $3. Um, and uh so we we we basically had had to send people throughout the Bay Area to go and buy USB cables.

**Interviewer:** Like like literally RadioShack? You like like Fry's?

**Elon Musk:** A Fry's, Fry's. No, that's better. They're going to have a hard time getting a a USB cable right now at Fry's. Oh, really? Cuz you bought every one of them.

**Interviewer:** That's good.

**Elon Musk:** Um, and and so we were able to continue production. And uh I don't I don't I don't believe the anecdote, but essentially the um the supplier is in China. Um, and we had plan A and plan B. Um, and plan A was like the normal supply chain process. And uh but but what the supplier did was instead of sending our uh uh parts in in their own package, they grouped it together with a bunch of other stuff for for for other companies and sent that all all via some extremely slow boat from China to LA. Um, and when it got to LA, the other stuff didn't pass customs. Oh. Um, and so they wouldn't they wouldn't let our stuff through because They put it in like a barrel of fruit or something. I don't know what I don't know what what what they put it in. But they they there's something that customs didn't like and the paperwork wasn't in order or whatever. So it got stuck there for for like a couple of weeks. And then we had plan B. So like so so we we called them, say, look, you got to air freight some of these cables cuz it's little cables um to us. Um, and we talked to their US subsidiary and ordered ordered from the US subsidiary, who then communicated to China. But then because uh this was another batch of of of parts, so it was kind of doubled the order. Um, it exceeded the credit limit that we had. Oh, yeah, you got it. So it bounced off their credit limit. So they they didn't ship it.

**Interviewer:** Fascinating. So so so someone's losing their job now. This is not

**Elon Musk:** No, no, you shouldn't you shouldn't you shouldn't fire anyone. Uh, it's I mean it's pretty farcical. And um Anyway, so it's coming like tonight at 11:00 p.m. or something.

**Interviewer:** Wow. And these things are happening like all the time? This is like an unusual circumstance?

**Elon Musk:** Yeah. Um, that's that's like one example, but there's there's many things like that. So I guess I mean that's actually a really good example cuz that kind of leads into what I've always been fascinated by a lot of what you're doing is Well, I I guess I Well, I'll start with How did you get into this? I mean, you know Into cars? into cars, into taking over NASA, into Well, not taking over NASA, no. Um, being a contractor for for for NASA. For the record, we're not taking over NASA.

**Interviewer:** Yes, yes. You're not taking over NASA. They're an independent organization. The the But you all are becoming a major uh uh provider of services for NASA. Um, obviously, kind of internet payments and payments generally. I mean, these are very three completely different spaces. I think a lot of people would not take someone seriously if they kind of had a business plan in one of these.

**Elon Musk:** Right.

**Interviewer:** Sorry to

**Elon Musk:** Oh yeah, you take take your time. Um, what what was your I mean, did you always think you were going to be doing this or When did it dawn on you that that you would try to revolutionize three industries?



=== Part Break ===

Interviewer: I flew to Russia three times to negotiate purchase of a an ICBM. That I tried to buy two of the biggest ICBMs in the Russian fleet in 2001 and 2002. Um and I actually negotiated. I'll just let that statement stand. I'm not even going to. Yeah. Um I I I mean that's uh And and and well I I actually I actually have to like who did you call? Like like I mean I I you open the yellow pages? Yeah, I I'm going I'm in the market. Like I mean how does this I mean I don't want to get too much in the but I am curious this is one particular thing. You are you decide at some point you need to buy an ICBM.

Elon Musk: Yeah. Well, actually at first I tried to buy just a normal rocket launch vehicle that they used to launch satellites. But those were too expensive.

Interviewer: I I see. I see.

Elon Musk: Um the the the Boeing Delta 2 would have cost $65 million each. And so two would have been 130 and then it was like whoa, okay, that breaks my budget right there.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Elon Musk: Um And and I tried to negotiate with them and that was not How much does an ICBM go for? I'm curious what's the market rate for one of those. Um well, this was right after the fall, it might have gone up.

Interviewer: Yeah, it's gone up a lot since then.

Elon Musk: But in in 2001 it it would have been about $10 million each for for so two would have been 20 and and then um and then I thought I could get the rest of the mission down to also around 10 per. So so we would have a dual mission with like two identical launches to identical spacecraft and um you know for like roughly $40 million and so I thought that okay, I'll I can do that.

Interviewer: And but you must have had some like, you know, rocket scientists advising you at this point. I mean this sounds like you were serious. I mean you were

Elon Musk: Yeah. Yeah, engaged a a bunch of sort of consultants and and kind of sort of get to get familiar with the space industry. And um but then after the third trip to Russia I I I came to realize that I was actually wrong about um that on on my first premise that that there was a lack of will. In fact, I think that there's tremendous amount of will in the United States for uh space exploration. Um because United States is essentially a nation of explorers. I mean it's a distillation of the human spirit of exploration. Um so of course um it was quite silly of me to think that that that that people lack motivation. But what people don't want to think is that okay, um going sending people to Mars is going to be so expensive that they'll have to give up like health care or something. They're not going to do that. Um so it's got to be it's it's got to be that going to Mars is not going to cause some meaningful to drop in their standard of living.

Interviewer: Right.

Elon Musk: You know, so if it's like maybe a quarter of a percent or half percent of GDP something like that is palatable. Um Anyway, so so so so I thought okay, it's not going really going to maybe matter that much if I do this mission because what really matters is is having a a way. So so I was wrong. I I I thought I thought I thought there was there wasn't enough will, but there actually was plenty of will if people thought there was a way. So so then I said okay, well I need to work on the way.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Elon Musk: Um How hard is it really to make a rocket? And history historically all rockets have been expensive. So therefore, in the future all rockets will be expensive. But actually not that's not true. If you say what is a rocket made of and say okay, it's made of aluminum, titanium, some copper, um carbon fiber if you want to go that direction, um and and you can break it down and say what is what is the raw material cost of all these components? And if you had them stacked on the floor and could wave a magic wand um so that the cost of rearranging the atoms was zero um then what would the cost of the rocket be?

Interviewer: Yeah.

Elon Musk: And I was like wow, okay, it's really small. It's like you know 2% of what a rocket costs. So clearly the be in how the atoms are arranged.

Interviewer: Right. Right.

Elon Musk: The the the other so so you got to figure out sort of okay, how can we get the atoms in the right shape um much more efficiently.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Elon Musk: And um so I had a series of of meetings on Saturdays with people that were some who were still working at the bigger aerospace companies just to try to figure out is there some catch here that I'm not that I'm not appreciating. And I couldn't figure out didn't seem to be any catch so started SpaceX.

Interviewer: And and you and you ended up building I mean you you had some failures but obviously some huge successes. What was the cost that you were able to build this rocket for relative to what what they were being built for before?

Elon Musk: So actually let's see. For for the Falcon 1 which was the first rocket we built and the first three flights did not make it. In fact, um yeah, I mean we got got sort of progressively further but um like the first rocket like came and cra landed maybe a couple hundred yards away from the launch site and you know tiny fragments. Um so uh yeah, um anyway that that that rocket ended up costing um around $6 million.

Interviewer: Wow.

Elon Musk: Um compared to other rockets in that class which were about say $25 million. So significant.

Interviewer: Wow. Significant.

Elon Musk: Yeah, like a quarter.

Interviewer: Wow. Wow.

Elon Musk: And but but but there's an even better step beyond that which is to make rockets reusable.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Elon Musk: Um so and right now our that that is around around what what our comparison price is excluding the refurbished ICBMs. So if you say building a rocket from new how does the SpaceX rocket compared to a rocket from Boeing Lockheed? It's about a quarter of the price.

Interviewer: Hmm.

Elon Musk: Um Um however, if we make it reusable then it can be two orders of magnitude cheaper.

Interviewer: Two orders of magnitude cheaper or 100th the price.

Elon Musk: That's right. So so I mean and to and I've seen Free. For for only only today we Memorial Day sale. Uh what what what what what And I've seen some y'all are doing like these vertical landings.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Elon Musk: Like like literally out of like the 1950s like like sci-fi movies.

Interviewer: Yep.

Elon Musk: And that's what you're talking about.

Elon Musk: Yeah. Yeah, essentially the rocket needs to come back and land at the launch site and then um reload propellant, take off again. Like an airplane.

Interviewer: And how far do you think we are from that? Like when when do you think like you know your best guess when we'll actually see that happening?

Elon Musk: I'm I'm hoping we can do it next year.

Interviewer: Oh okay. That's Um We got we've got some ambitious stuff at Khan Academy for next year too so we can compare it. Um We're redesigning the site, you know.

Interviewer: Right.

Elon Musk: Um We've been working on it for a long time. I I should say SpaceX has been around for 11 years and thus far we have not recovered any rockets. We've recovered the spacecraft uh from orbit. So that that that was great. Um but none of our attempts to recover the rocket stages have been successful. Um the rocket stages have always blown up basically on re-entry.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Elon Musk: Yeah. Now we think we've we think we figured out why that that was the case. Um and it's a tricky thing cuz Earth's gravity is really quite strong. Um and with uh advanced an advanced rocket you can do maybe 2 to 3% of your lift-off mass to orbit. Um typically. And then reusability subtracts 2 to 3%.

Interviewer: Hmm. Because you have to Yeah. Yeah.

Elon Musk: So then you've got like nothing to orbit or negative.

Interviewer: Right. And and that's obviously not helpful. Um And uh so the trick is to try to shift that from say 2 to 3% in in an expendable configuration put to to make the rocket um mass efficiency, engine efficiency and so forth so much better that it it moves to around maybe 3 1/2 to 4% in in expendable configuration. And then try to get clever about the reusability elements and try to drop that to around the 2 1 1/2 to 2% level. So you have a net payload to orbit of about 2%.

Interviewer: But you're doing it at one two orders of magnitude cheaper.

Elon Musk: Yeah, absolutely cuz so our Falcon 9 rocket costs about $60 million. But the propellant uh cost which is mostly oxygen, it's two-thirds oxygen, one-third fuel um is only about $200,000.

Interviewer: Wow.

Elon Musk: Um it's much like a like a 747. Costs about as much to uh refuel our rocket as it does to refuel a 747, you know, within you know pretty close essentially. So what I mean if assuming y'all are successful and y'all have proven yourselves to be much you know successful on kind of these audacious things in the past. I mean what happens? I mean that seems like it's I mean what happens in the next 5 10 years in the space industry if y'all are successful there? Um I mean do we get to Mars? Do we do we have kind of uh market forces, commercialization of space starting to happen?

Elon Musk: Yeah. Um See. Well, the the first step is that we need to earn enough money to keep going as a company. So we have to make sure that we're launching satellites uh you know commercial satellites like um uh broadcast communications, mapping, um and the government satellites that do scientific missions uh Earth-based or or space-based missions, GPS satellites, that kind of thing. Um and and then also servicing the space station, transferring cargo to and from the space station which we've done a few times. And and then taking people to and from the space station. So so we've got a we've got a service that sort of needs um Earth-based needs to launch satellites and that that pays the bills. But but in doing that keep improving the technology to the point where uh we we can make full reusability work and we have sufficient scale and sophistication to be able to take people to Mars.

Interviewer: Wow. And so you think this is going to be a reality? What what what's your best guess when we're going to have someone on Mars?

Elon Musk: I think I think probably about 12 years.

Interviewer: 12? That's that's not And and you think it'll be a round trip? It'll it'll be it'll it won't just be a some type of permanent colony on on Mars? Yeah.

Elon Musk: I think it's probably a round trip.

Interviewer: Wow. So so for for I mean it's not for sure. I I I could I could talk about this for I mean people know I I absolutely aspiration will be around trip.

Interviewer: Yeah. No, this this this yeah, this is mind-blowing. And I mean then on Tesla. I I mean Tesla is obviously I mean from from our from my vantage it's a huge success. I mean it's I mean what do you think is is in in that in Well well one I mean I'll ask kind of the same question. What did you think you you know this is something that GM and Toyota and these massive multi-billion dollar organizations have been trying you know what gave you the confidence to kind of pursue it? And and now that it it seems to be a a huge success where do you think this industry is going to be in the next 5 10 years?

Elon Musk: Um yeah, so with with Tesla the goal is to try to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport. Um I think it would happen anyway cuz just out of necessity. But um because we have an unpriced externality in the cost of gasoline Um we're we're not pricing in the environmental effects of CO2 in the oceans and atmosphere uh that that's causing um the norm the normal market forces to not function properly. And so the goal of Tesla is to uh try to act as a catalyst to accelerate um that those sort of normal forces that that the normal sort of market reaction that would would occur. Um we're trying to have a catalytic effect on that.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Elon Musk: And and try to make it happen I don't know maybe 10 years sooner than it would otherwise occur.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Elon Musk: Uh that's that's that's the goal of of Tesla. So that's the reason we're making electric cars and not any other kind of car. And we also supply power trains to Toyota and to Mercedes and and maybe to other car companies in the future to um accelerate their um uh production of electric vehicles. So so that that's the that's the sort of goal there and so far it's you know working out pretty well. I mean I just saw a news report earlier today that y'all are sold more to Model Ss than uh y'all are leading that segment of of the industry that the Mercedes S-class, the BMW 7 series or the the Lexus uh LS 400 or whatever it is.

Interviewer: Right.

Elon Musk: Uh yeah, actually that that seems to be the case. Um And that's uh yeah, I didn't realize they sold so few cars in that segment.

Interviewer: That's Cuz we don't sell that many cars. We sell 5,000 a quarter, you know, 20,000.

Interviewer: Well, out here they seem like you know everybody.

Elon Musk: Yeah, I mean well this is our home.

Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. This our home team, you know. Um So it's uh we we we better sell out in the Bay Area.

Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's where like No but that's And and and Well I mean same similar thing. I mean what what how did you start? What gave you the confidence and and I mean do do you see yourselves I mean it's kind of a major automotive mainstream brand in in 5 10 years all the way down to kind of the you know the competing with the Honda Accords and Civics?

Elon Musk: Um yeah, I mean I I I mean the goal is not uh just it's not sort of to become a bra big brand or to compete with uh Honda Civics uh but rather to advance the course of electric vehicles.

Interviewer: Hmm.

Elon Musk: So we're just going to keep making more and more electric cars and driving the price point down until the industry is very firmly electric. You know, like maybe half of all cars made are electric or something like that. Which is not to say that we expect to make all half of all cars. We we we want to just have that catalytic effect until at least that occurs. And I think at the point which there's you know we're approaching half of all new cars made are electric then I think that's I would consider that to be kind of the victory condition.

Interviewer: Wow.

Elon Musk: Um And and so the faster we can bring that day the the better.

Interviewer: Wow. When when would be your guess when that happens?

Elon Musk: Um well, I made a bet with someone about 3 years ago that it would be sooner than 20 years, so it's 17 years from now. But I but that's I think I I that's conservative. I think it's probably you know but maybe maybe 13 or 14 years, something like that.

Interviewer: Wow. Right right about the time Right when we're going to Mars. It'll it'll be it'll be exciting exciting times.

Elon Musk: Yeah. Absolutely. True. That's that's it just could yeah. Exactly. I was just thinking about that. It was like oh those time frames are kind of coincident.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Elon Musk: Um S uh yeah. I mean the the nature of of new technology adoption is it tends to follow an S-curve. So so what usually happens is people under predict it in the beginning cuz people tend to extrapolate on a straight line and and then they'll over predict it kind of at the midpoint and cuz there's there's late adopters and then you know it it it'll actually take longer than people think at the midpoint but much shorter than people think at the beginning.

Interviewer: Yeah. Yeah.

Elon Musk: Um And um yeah but I'm pretty excited about how things are going. It's um and in fact I think I think that the the pace of technology improvement is in in energy storage electric electric energy storage is is really moving faster than anyone thinks.

Interviewer: Wow. Wow. I got one one more What are we doing on time? Where's after?

Interviewer: 9:00.

Interviewer: Oh 9:00. So how much time do you have? We I want to make sure we Uh well I guess maybe another 15 minutes.

Interviewer: Oh okay. Okay. Um so I'll finish with one last question then we'll open it up. I mean what what advice do you have for us um at Khan Academy? I mean we're doing really great so Yeah. So I was wondering if you had advice for me.

Elon Musk: Oh no well Um Yeah, I I I I mean it seems like you're doing doing doing an amazing job of really really super leveraged. You know, I mean obviously small team and you're having a dramatic effect on Half these people don't even work here.

Interviewer: They're just like So like it's even Yeah.

Interviewer: Right. It's right. So it's uh I think very impressive uh thing you're doing um to to spread knowledge and and understanding you know throughout the world.

Interviewer: The the universe soon.

Elon Musk: Throughout the universe if you if you hold up your end of the bargain. Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's actually kind of funny like like um you know if you think of like what is education? Like you're basically downloading data and algorithms into your brain. And it it's it's actually amazingly bad in conventional education cuz like it shouldn't be like this huge chore. Um uh so you're making it way way better. Um But I mean I think I think I think a lot of the things that I would say you've probably heard a hundred times um and in effect are if if not doing like the more you can gamify the uh the process of learning the better. Like for my kids I do not have to encourage them to play video games. Okay? I have to like pry them from their hands like like crack.

Interviewer: Yeah. Yeah.

Elon Musk: Yeah. Yes. It's like drop that crack needle.

Interviewer: Yeah. Yeah.

Interviewer: You have that problem at your house too. Yeah. Exactly. The crack is addictive.

Elon Musk: Yeah. Um So so so it's you know it's to the degree that you can make uh somehow learning like a game that that then it's it's better. Um And I think unfortunately like a lot of education is very boring. Um that you you've got uh you know someone standing up there kind of lecturing at people um and they've done the same lecture for 20 years in a row and they're not very excited about it and that lack of enthusiasm you know is conveyed to the students that they're not very excited about it. They don't know why they're there. Like why are we learning this stuff? We don't even know why. Um in fact I think a lot of things people learn probably there's no point in in learning them. Um cuz they they never use them in in the future.

Interviewer: Cuz who's going to launch a rocket into space? I mean that's just like

Elon Musk: Yeah. Yeah exactly. That never happens.

Elon Musk: Um Well you have to say like people I think don't stand back and say well why are are we teaching people these things and we should tell them probably why we're teaching these things. Cuz a lot of kids are just in in school kind of puzzled as to why they're there.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Elon Musk: Yeah. Um And I think if you can explain the why of things then that makes a huge difference to people's motivation. And they understand they understand purpose.

Interviewer: Yeah.

Elon Musk: Um So I think that's pretty important uh and just make make it entertaining. But I think just in general like conventional education should be massively overhauled and I'm sure you very much agree with that but yeah. So So I mean the analogy I I sometimes use is like if you've seen like Batman like the Christopher Nolan movie like the recent one and it's pretty freaking awesome, right? Um And you've got incredible special effects, great script, uh multiple takes, amazing actors and great sound and it's very it's very engaging. Um but if if you were to instead say okay that ha even if you had the same script, so let's just say the same script and you said okay, now that script instead of having movies we're we're going to have that that script performed by the local town troop.

Interviewer: Right.

Elon Musk: Okay and and so every in every small town in America if movies didn't exist they would have to then re recreate the Dark Knight you know with like home like homemade costumes and like you know jumping across the stage and not not getting their lines quite right and not really looking like you know the the people in in in the in the in the movie and and no special effects and everything and I mean that would suck.

Interviewer: It would be terrible.

Elon Musk: That's that's that's right. That's yeah. Very very That's education. That's education.

Interviewer: So so with that and and and I apologize to all of you guys for hogging up all of the time because obviously I could talk for hours about this stuff. But I and we do have time I think 5 or 10 minutes for for a handful of questions. Um if none of y'all have any I have about nine more but yes.

Interviewer 2: Yeah, so I noticed uh I picked up two kind of themes from from what you were discussing. One was uh somewhat audacious goals. Um and the other was I don't think I heard you use the word profit in anything that you spoke about. Um you seem to be each each thing is pointed at like reinvigorating an industry or bringing back uh space missions. How much of your success do you attribute to having really audacious goals or versus um just not being focused on the short-term you know money coming in or on on investors?

Elon Musk: Of course I I

=== Part Break ===

Speaker 1: One one does have to be focused on the short term of money coming in when creating a company because otherwise the company will will die. So that the I think that a lot of times people think like creating a company is going to be fun. I would say it's not it's really not that fun. I mean there are periods of fun and there are there are periods of where it's where it's just awful. Um and particularly if you're the CEO of the company, um you actually have a distillation of all the worst problems in the company. Um there's no point in spending your time on things that are going right. So you only spend on things on your time on things that are going wrong. And and there are things that are going wrong that other people can't can't take care of. So you have like the worst you have a filter for the crappiest problem in the company. The most pernicious and painful problem. Um so I wouldn't say it's it's I think you have to feel quite compelled to do it. Um and have a a fairly high pain threshold. And there's a friend of mine who who says like starting a company is like staring into the abyss and and eating glass. Um and there's some truth to that. Um the staring into the abyss part is that you're going to be constantly facing the the um extermination of the company. Uh because most most startups fail. Uh it's like 90% probably 99% of of startups fail. So uh so you you that that's the staring into the abyss part. You're constantly saying, okay, this if if if I don't get this right, the company will die. Um should be quite stressful quite stressful. And and then um the eating glass part is you've got you've got to do you've got to do the problems you got to you got to work on the problems that the company needs you to work on, not the problems you want to work on. And so that the that's you're not working on problems that that uh you'd really wish you weren't working on. And so that's that's the eating glass part. Um and that goes on for a long time.

Speaker 2: So how do you keep your focus on the big picture when you're constantly faced with we could be out of business in a month?

Speaker 1: Well, it's it's just a very small percentage of mental energy is on the on the big picture. Like you know you know you know where you're generally heading for and and the the actual path is going to be some sort of zig-zaggy thing in that direction. Um and you try not to deviate too far from the path that that that you want to be on, but you're going to have to do that to some degree. Um but I I don't want to I don't want to diminish the I mean I think the part the profit motive is a is a is a good one if the rules of an industry are properly set up. So there's nothing fundamentally wrong with profit. In fact, profit just means that uh people are paying you more for this whatever you're doing then you're spending to create it. That's a good thing. And and if if you're not if if that's not the case, then you'll be out of business and rightfully so. Because you're you're you're not adding enough value. Now there are cases of course where people uh will do bad things in order to um achieve profit, but but that's actually uh quite unusual. I mean because because usually the the rules are set up mostly correctly. Like not completely, but mostly correctly.

Speaker 3: Well, I think we have time for one one more question. Joel, this is Yeah, I've got an important one. Okay, very good. Yes, please.

Speaker 4: Okay, so a few months ago you teased Hyperloop. Um and we haven't heard anything since. Um so first of all, a few of us engineers were talking about it and I think we have a few ideas if you need help. But if you feel comfortable, uh maybe you could tell us a little bit more.

Speaker 1: Uh I was reading about the California high-speed rail and it was quite depressing. Um because uh California taxpayers are going to be on the hook to you know to to build the most expensive uh high-speed rail per mile in the world and the slowest. Um which is those are not the superlatives you want. And and it's like damn, like we're in California, we make super high-tech stuff. Why are we going to be spending a hundred not not the estimates are around $100 billion for uh something that that will take 2 hours to go from um LA to to San Francisco. I'm like, okay, well I can get on a plane and do that in 45 minutes. Um it doesn't make much sense. Uh and isn't there some better way to do it than that? Um so so uh if if you just say, okay, well, what would you ideally want in in a in a transportation system? You'd say, okay, well, you'd want something that relative to existing modes of transportation is faster, let's say twice as fast, costs half as much per ticket, um can't crash, is immune to weather, um and is you know you could make the whole thing like self-powering with like solar panels or something like that. That would be pretty That would be That would be a good outcome. Yes. Um and so what what would do that? Um and what's the fastest way short of inventing teleportation that you could do something like that? Uh and some of the elements of that solution are fairly obvious and some of it some of them are not so obvious. Um and then the details um the devil's in the details of actually making something like that work. Um but uh I came to the conclusion that that that there is something like that that could work. Um and would be practical.

Speaker 3: Is this the around the evacuated tubes? The the vacuum tubes? Um something like that. Something like that. Yeah. Have you haven't been more public with with what this is?

Speaker 1: No. Um No, well I did say that once Tesla was profitable that I would uh talk more about it. Um but we haven't done our earnings call yet, so I think it's probably good Yeah. after the earnings call. Um and it the thing is like I I kind of strung out on the things that I'm doing, so adding another Yeah. Just like doesn't you know that's Learning the guitar, you could you could pick up yeah, all sorts of things. Right. I I tried learning the violin. That's by the way a hard thing to learn. Yeah. I mean Launching rockets, electric cars, revolutionizing transportation, yeah, that's easy. Um I can't play the violin at all. Very horrible. Um you know if you think about the future, you want a future that's better than the past. And and so if we had something like the Hyperloop, I think that would be like cool. Like you'd look forward to the day that that was working. You know, and and if something like that even if it was only even if it only was in one place, you know, from LA to San Francisco or New York to DC or something like that, then um it would be cool enough that it would be like a tourist attraction. Maybe like a ride or something, you know. So so even if if um some of the initial assumptions didn't work out and the economics didn't didn't didn't work out quite as as we expected, it would be like cool enough that like I want to journey that place just to just to ride on that thing. That would be pretty cool. Um and so that's I think how if if you come up with a new technology it should it should feel like that. You should really like if you told it to an objective person, would they look forward to the day that that thing became available? And and like you know, be pretty exciting to to do something like that. Um or or an aircraft. Like I thought it was really disappointing when the when the Concorde was taken out of commission and there was no supersonic uh transport available. Um and of course the 787 has had some issues. Um So um but it's but the thing is the 787 even in the best case scenario is only a slightly better version of the triple seven. Um and it's like okay, you know, not that exciting.

Speaker 3: So so there there this is something that you are working on and and one day in the not too far future or there's some plans or consultants involved or something?

Speaker 1: Um There you've made some phone calls to Russia. Um No, every now and then like this like it's sort of percolating away and then I I I'm not I'm not actively thinking about it, but then there'll be some new element of that I'll think oh well, you know, this would make it better.

Speaker 3: Fascinating. Um yeah. No, well, I think I'm speaking for everyone. This is like the most epic possible conversation one could have over about the course of an hour and I think all of us would love to chat with you for hours on end. But thank you so much. I mean, I know you have a lot of free time, so it probably wasn't that big of a deal for you to come here. Uh but yeah, it was a huge honor and I think it's inspired all of us to go out and change the world and end the universe.

Speaker 1: Cool. Thank you very much.
